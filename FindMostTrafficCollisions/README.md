# Find Most Traffic Collisions

## Problem Statement

Carburetor Springs Police Department is looking to improve their response
times to traffic collisions by setting up cameras at the intersection
with the most traffic collisions.

Carburetor Springs Police Department decided to hire you to help them
determine which intersection has the most traffic collision events.

You have been provided with a dataset consisting of history of events
collected from the police department's records management system.

Explanation of the Input:
    An event consists of 3 fields: {street1, street2, numVehiclesInvolved}

Which will be provided to you in way that works for whatever language you pick.
    Example: {"Greenwich", "Spring", 1},
         or: { street1: "Greenwich", street2: "Spring", numVehiclesInvolved: 1 },

Consider the following example.

Input:
```
[
    { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 3 },
    { street1: "6th", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 4 },
    { street1: "6th", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 2 },
    { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 2 },
    { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Canal", numVehiclesInvolved: 3 },
    { street1: "Hudson", street2: "Dominick", numVehiclesInvolved: 2 },
    { street1: "Greenwich", street2: "Spring", numVehiclesInvolved: 1 },
    { street1: "Greenwich", street2: "Spring", numVehiclesInvolved: 0 },
]
```

Output: 
```
"Hudson & Canal"
```

In this example, the intersection, "Hudson & Canal" has the most traffic collisions and is
therefore the most traffic-collision-prone intersection.

Letâ€™s talk about your plan of attack before you start coding, and remember
to keep talking me through what you are doing as you code.
Don't forget to consider any possible edge cases.
